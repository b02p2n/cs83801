Task 1) Model an AUV with two differential surge propellers and provide a sketch of the AUV that shows its key
dimensions. Provide a table detailling the parameters needed to model its dynamics. Describe the equations and
assumptions used to determine these parameters, and the sensors you would use to overcome deficiencies in your
model. [4/30 marks]
Task 2) For the AUV you defined in Task 1, generate a trajectory for a lawnmowever survey that covers a region of
50x50m with a spacing between parallel lines of 2m. Provide a table with your assumed forward speed, angular rate,
turning circle and the waypoint acceptance radius. Justify your choice of values for each parameter, fully explaining the
assumption you make on AUV manouvrability. Estimate how long the mission will take. Provide figures of both your
original waypoints and the trajectories you generated. Explain the methods used to 代 写program、Python/Java
代做程序编程语言generate these. [4/30 marks]
Task 3) Implement state space control for the AUV you defined in Task 1 following the method taught in the module.
Show the trajectories for these as a Northings, Eastings plot, together with the twist and thruster force command time
histories. Repeat these for at least three different gain parameters, and identify the gain parameters you would chose in a
final application, providing evidence to justify your choice of parameters. [12/30 marks]
Task 4) Describe the limitations of the state-space control method you implemented in Task 3). Refer to the following
paper and at least 2 other journal papers that present methods that address the limitations you identified in your
implemented approach.
Gonzalez-Garcia, Alejandro, Castaneda, Herman, Guidance and Control Based on Adaptive Sliding Mode Strategy for a
USV Subject to Uncertainties (2021) IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering, 46 (4), pp. 1144 - 1154, DOI:
10.1109/JOE.2021.3059210
Explain how these methods can offer benefits over your implemented approach. 500 word limit. [10/30 marks]
